This project implements an advanced keylogger in Python. A keylogger is a type of surveillance software designed to record keystrokes on a device without the user's knowledge. This keylogger is capable of capturing various types of data, including keystrokes, system information, clipboard content, audio recordings, and screenshots.

Features
Keystroke Logging: Records all keystrokes typed by the user.
System Information: Gathers information about the system, including hostname, IP address, processor, operating system, etc.
Clipboard Logging: Captures content copied to the clipboard.
Audio Recording: Records audio from the microphone for a specified duration.
Screenshot Capture: Takes screenshots of the user's screen.
Email Reporting: Sends collected data via email to a specified address.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure the email address and password for sending logs in the keylogger.py file.
Run the keylogger.py script.
The keylogger will start capturing data silently in the background.
To stop the keylogger, terminate the script manually.
